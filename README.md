# Eigen-clustering-parcellation
Group-level functionally parcellation using density-based clustering, combining density-peaks clustering(DPC) and Laplacian eigenmaps(LE)
# Paper download:
You can download the paper "Functional Parcellation of Human Brain Precuneus Using Density-Based Clustering" and view details on https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/30/1/269/5482328.
# Usage:
Run the three demo files: calculate_fc_demo.m, calculate_dist_demo.m, and group_parcellation_demo.m to complete the example three steps for group parcellation.
# Notes:
1. Replace 'source_path' in each demo file with the path where you place this 'group_parcellation' folder.
2. If you need evaluate the performance under each reduced dimension of the Laplacian eigenvectors to choose the best reduced dimension, you can refer the three files in 'aid-functions' folder, for calculating the cluster validity index (CI), the symmetry index (SI) and the number of scatters (NS) seperately.
